# Deep-Learning-Models

The repository includes different types of pratical deep learning models which became the computer assignments of [Deep Learning and Practice course](http://mapl.nctu.edu.tw/course/DL_2019/index.php) in National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University. 

## Spelling Corrector - Sequence-to-sequence Recurrent Neural Networks

Given a mistakenly spelling word, seq2seq (autoencoder) mode will try to output a correct one.

## Tense Converter

## Geometry Generator - Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks

GAN will output a picture with 1 to 3 objects with specific shapes and colors based on given conditions.
